        "* Learn how to design a simple AI agent with persistent long-term memory using basic Python file I/O.\n",
        "* Understand how to store user input across sessions by writing to a local .txt file.\n",
        "* Learn to recall and display past memories through dynamic reading of file contents.\n",
        "* Gain insight into exception handling, specifically how to manage file-not-found scenarios gracefully.\n",
        "* Practice building an interactive console agent loop that interprets commands like \"recall\" and \"exit\" in real-time.\n",
        "* Reinforce the use of string operations and control flow to differentiate between memory-related and generic user inputs.\n",
        "* Build intuition for memory lifecycle: how an agent can accumulate knowledge over time using simple append strategies.\n",
        "* Develop modular thinking by separating concerns into dedicated functions: one for memory writing and one for reading.\n",
        "* Lay the foundation for scaling to more advanced memory formats like JSON, vector stores, or database-backed memory."
