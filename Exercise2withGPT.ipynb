        "Exercise 2 (Based on Program 6 & 7): Write a Python program that simulates an AI Agent responsible for monitoring the health of microservices in a distributed system. There are 4 services: \"AuthService\", \"PaymentService\", \"InventoryService\", and \"EmailService\". Each service has three attributes: CPU usage (%), Memory usage (MB), and Error rate (%). These values change randomly over time.\n",
        "The agent should:\n",
        "1. Every 5 seconds (simulated), check the status of all services.\n",
        "2. If a service has CPU usage > 85%, memory usage > 900MB, or error rate > 5%, consider it “unhealthy”.\n",
        "3. For each unhealthy service, choose one of these actions:\n",
        "3.1 \"restart\" (medium impact, medium cost)\n",
        "3.2 \"scale up\" (high impact, high cost)\n",
        "3.3 \"ignore\" (no cost, but risky if continued)\n",
        "4. Use a simple utility score for each action based on this formula:\n",
        "Utility = (Service Severity × Impact Score) - Cost\n",
        "5. Pick the action with the highest utility score and apply it.\n",
        "6. Print a decision log that explains:\n",
        "6.1 Which service was unhealthy\n",
        "6.2 What decision was made\n",
        "6.3 Why it was chosen (with utility score breakdown)\n",
        "\n",
        "Simulate 10 cycles and stop."
